# Concurrent - Essential Design Rules

## Aesthetic
- Amber/orange CRT terminal look
- No rounded corners, ever
- Monospace everything
- Dark, dense, glowing
- Never use `>` or `>>` prefixes before text (no fake terminal prompts)

## UX
- Information always visible - no hiding behind menus
- Status based on terminal OUTPUT, not process state
- Keyboard shortcuts for everything important
- All messages to the user from the system should be prefixed with "[Admin]"
